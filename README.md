Ticket-pool raffle platform: React/Vite/Tailwind frontend + Express/PostgreSQL backend.

## What's included

- Wallet ledger, ticket-pool games, secure server-side draw (`crypto.randomInt`)
- **Pick-your-ticket**: buy any open number in a pool, not just the next one
- **Deposits**: user pays a sample CBE/Telebirr account, uploads a screenshot
  (stored on **Cloudinary**, not local disk — safe for Render's ephemeral
  filesystem), admin approves/rejects before the wallet is credited
- **Withdrawals**: payout profile (bank or Telebirr), **10% fee**, **100 ETB
  minimum** — both configurable via env vars. Funds are held on request,
  refunded automatically if rejected
- **Points, levels, and a wheel spin**: 1 point per 100 ETB deposited; at 50
  points, spend them on a spin of a circular prize wheel for a 5–50 ETB
  bonus; level is derived from lifetime points. The same wheel component
  also drives the ticket-draw reveal for pools with 20 or fewer tickets
- **Invite & earn**: every user gets a unique referral code/link. When an
  invited friend's deposit is approved and it's at least 100 ETB (both
  configurable), the inviter is instantly paid 10 ETB + 5 points
- **Auto-verified deposits via SMS bridge**: users enter the transaction
  reference from their bank/Telebirr receipt when depositing. An Android
  phone forwards the admin's incoming CBE/Telebirr SMS notifications to the
  backend, which parses and matches them against pending deposits — a match
  auto-approves instantly; anything else stays pending for manual review.
  See "Auto-verifying deposits" below
- **Bottom tab navigation** (Games / Tickets / Wallet / Profile) — mobile-app
  style, built with `lucide-react` icons
- **Amharic + English**, Amharic by default, toggle in Profile, persisted
  in `localStorage`
- Live toasts on ticket purchase / deposit / withdrawal actions, with a
  friendly message (not a raw HTTP error) if you're rate-limited
- Winner announcement banner: recently completed draws shown to every
  logged-in user, dismissible per-win

## Local setup

```bash
# 1. Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in Postgres + JWT_SECRET + Cloudinary creds
npm run migrate         # applies all migrations
npm run dev              # http://localhost:4000

# 2. Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5173
```

## Making your first admin

```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE phone = '+2519XXXXXXXX';
```
Log out and back in afterward — the role is baked into the JWT at login time.

## Auto-verifying deposits

Users type in the transaction reference/ID from their bank or Telebirr
receipt when submitting a deposit. To have matching deposits approved
automatically instead of always waiting on an admin, set up the Android
SMS bridge — see `android-sms-bridge/README.md` for the full walkthrough.
Two setup options are documented there: **MacroDroid** (no-code, a free
Android automation app — recommended) or a small **Termux script**. Until
you set `BANK_SMS_API_KEY` in the backend `.env`, every deposit just goes
to the normal manual admin review queue, exactly as before.

## Deploying for free: Vercel + Render + Supabase

**1. Supabase — Postgres**
Create a project at supabase.com. Under Settings → Database, copy the
connection details (host, user, password, database) — use the **pooler**
connection (port 6543) if you want, both work. Postgres from Supabase
requires SSL, which `backend/src/config/db.js` already handles by default.

Run migrations against it from your own machine (Render's free tier has no
shell/pre-deploy step):
```bash
cd backend
# .env pointed at your Supabase credentials
npm run migrate
```

**2. Cloudinary — deposit screenshot storage**
Create a free account at cloudinary.com. From the dashboard, copy your
Cloud name, API key, and API secret — these go into `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`,
`CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`. No bucket/folder setup
needed — the app creates assets under a folder automatically on first
upload.

**3. Render — backend**
New Web Service → connect your repo → Root Directory `backend` (or use the
included `render.yaml` via "New → Blueprint" for one-click env var
scaffolding). Build command `npm install`, start command `npm start`,
health check path `/health`. Add all the env vars from `backend/.env.example`
in the Render dashboard (Supabase Postgres creds, `JWT_SECRET`, Cloudinary
keys, `FRONTEND_URL` once you know your Vercel domain).

Render's free tier sleeps after ~15 minutes of no traffic; the first
request after that takes 30–50s to wake up. A free uptime pinger (e.g.
cron-job.org hitting `/health` every 10 min) avoids this for a live app.

**4. Vercel — frontend**
Import the repo → Root Directory `frontend` → framework preset Vite
(build command and output directory are auto-detected). Add one env var:
`VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com/api`. The included
`vercel.json` handles client-side routing so refreshing `/wallet` etc.
doesn't 404.

Once both are live, go back to Render and set `FRONTEND_URL` to your exact
Vercel URL (e.g. `https://zemen-lottery.vercel.app`) so CORS allows it.

Each folder's own README has the full API reference and design notes.
